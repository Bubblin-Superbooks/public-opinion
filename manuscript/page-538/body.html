<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Chapter XXIII</h4><h5 class="  ">The Nature Of News</h5><p>ALL the reporters in the world working all the hours of the day could not witness all the happenings in the world. There are not a great many reporters. And none of them has the power to be in more than one place at a time. Reporters are not clairvoyant, they do not gaze into a crystal ball and see the world at will, they are not assisted by thought-transference. Yet the range of subjects these comparatively few men manage to cover would be a miracle indeed, if it were not a standardized routine.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Newspapers do not try to keep an eye on all mankind.  They have watchers stationed at certain places, like Police Headquarters, the Coroner's Office, the County Clerk's Office, City Hall, the White House, the Senate, House of Representatives, and so forth.</p></div> </div>
