We have no desire for any part of her territory. We wish her to have peace, stability and prosperity. We should be ready to aid her in binding up her wounds, in relieving her from starvation and distress, in giving her in every practicable way the benefits of our disinterested friendship. The conduct of this administration has created difficulties which we shall have to surmountâ€¦. <em>We shall have to adopt a new policy,</em> a policy of <em>firmness</em> and consistency through which alone we can promote an enduring <em>friendship.</em>"</p><p>The theme friendship is for the non-interventionists, the theme "new policy" and "firmness" is for the interventionists. On the non-contentious record, the detail is overwhelming; on the issue everything is cloudy.</p></div> </div>
